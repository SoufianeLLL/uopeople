# Why We Use JAR Files

In this project, we use JAR files to manage and distribute our dependencies and application components. JAR files are a convenient way to bundle multiple Java classes, metadata, and resources into a single archive. This approach simplifies the process of including external libraries and dependencies, such as the Jackson library for JSON processing, into our project.
